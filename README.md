simple tests of genetic, ant and swarm algoritms

gen1 - A simple genetic algorithm for finding the minimum of a function from 1 variable in a certain interval. To change the function, override the GetFunction() method, the rest of the parameters are set in the main window. 

gen2 - A genetic algoritm for finding the minimum of a function from 2 variable in  a certain interval. To change the To change the function, override the GetFunction() method, the rest of the parameters are set in the main window.

gen3 - The solution of the traveling salesman problem by methods of genetic algorithms. The model is set by a text file indicating the coordinates of the cities. The algorithm parameters are set by controls in the main window.

gen4 - Solving the problem of painting a graph with a minimum number of colors by methods of genetic algorithms. The algorithm parameters are set by the controls in the main window, the result is displayed there as well.

gen5 - Finding the minimum of a function of two variables by the method of the 1+1 evolutionary strategy. Comparison with the results of the work gen2. The algorithm parameters are set by the controls in the main window, the result is displayed there as well.

gen6 - Finding the minimum of a function from two variables using swarm algorithms with a global optimum. Comparison with the results of the work. The algorithm parameters are set by the controls in the main window.

gen7 - The problem of finding a Hamiltonian path by methods of ant algorithms. the graph is set by a text file Graph.txt . The algorithm parameters are set by the controls in the main window, the result is displayed there as well/
